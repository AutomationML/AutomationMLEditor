<h5 id="changes">Changes</h5>
<p>In this version of the editor, the appearance of the editor has been
changed a little. A slightly improved icon library is used to
represent the AutomationML objects, in which the icons have been
made slightly more readable and the display efficiency has been optimized.
This library is publicly available via the AutomationML website.</p>
<p>Attributes are now also displayed in the tree view of the attribute type library.
This simplifies the construction of an attribute type library by making it easier
to copy attributes back and forth between attribute types.</p>
<h5 id="notes-to-plugin-developers">Notes to plugin developers</h5>
<p>This Version supports a new Plugin Interface <em>INotifyAMLDocumentSaved</em>. Plugins, implementing this
interface get a notification when an AMLFile has been saved by the AutomationML Editor.
The Plugin contract has to be updated to version 2.4.0 to use this interface.</p>
