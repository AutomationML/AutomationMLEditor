### [Version 6.4.0](https://github.com/AutomationML/AutomationMLEditor/releases/tag/v6.4.0) 

#### Major Changes
- This version introduces a **new licence model** for the Editor. 
    1. As before, there is an AutomationML Editor Free version without a licence file. It contains all the basic features and functions, but with some function and model limitations.
	2. A new AutomationML Editor Plus version is available with an extended range of functions and fewer functional restrictions.
	3. The full version is the AutomationML Editor Premium version with the full range of functions without model limitations.
  
  Please note, that the feature restrictions for the free version have changed.

- The method for integrating editor plugins has been changed. Existing versions of already loaded plugins must be replaced by new versions. To do this, all plugins must be manually uninstalled and reinstalled using the editor's plugin manager. Corresponding new versions are available for the plugins offered by the AutomationML Association. Self-developed plugins must be converted to the new method. The procedure is described on the development page for plugins.
- The function for deactivating the aml file service has been removed. It is no longer possible to import AML download resources from the AML website.

#### Changes
- When a new version of a library, class or attribute type is created, the new version will keep the ID of the original version. 
- An InternalElement or ExternalInterface can be moved interactively, even if there are InternalLink relations to the moved element.  
- When an attribute type instance is created, no header data of the type is transferred to the attribute.
- When saving a document, local file paths in external references are changed to relative or absolute file urls depending on where the file is saved.
- When loading a document, it is checked whether paths in external references are redirected to new addresses. If redirected addresses exist, the external references are changed and a message is displayed in the status information.
- If an external reference to a local automationml file is inserted which is an extension, a reference is also added to the extended document.
- If an AutomationML object is created whose class is not found in a referenced library, such as when creating a group, a dialog is displayed to select the library version in which the class is defined.  
- If an edited library is a new version of a library, names and IDs of classes can only be edited, if the version is defined as a new major version.
- If a library extension is referenced and a new version of an extended library is found an upgrade option for the extended library version is not notified.
- The nameing consistency rule defined for consistent document and library names has been changed. The '.' character is allowed, i.e. to classify a domain with a sub domain. 
- The AutomationML library server has been renamed to AML library space.
- When an AttributeType is derived from a base Type, the datatype of the base type is also assigned to the derived type.
- CAEXPath characters, used to mark escape sequences in a path are omitted from class- and role- reference representations in tree views.

#### New Features
- When no document is loaded, all tree view backgrounds change to a light gray color.
- The publication consistency check results protocol provides new options for filtering results according to result type. 
- A new option in the Document References can be used to set that all externally referenced documents are always opened when opening a document.
- Additional consistency checks related to versioning rules and type references are executed when a library is published.
- Find Online Dialog and External Class Reference Dialog provide additional information about selected classes.
- The Attribute Tree View Add-Button allows to reference external attribute types.
- It is now possible to add multiple extended versions of the same library to an extension document. The method is provided in the context menue of a library tree view pane.
- New consistency rules for the naming of extension versions of libraries have been added.

#### BugFixes
- If an element is selected in the tree view which can not have assigned attributes (as for example InstanceHierarchies), the attribute view switches to an empty view.
- When a class was moved in the class tree, not all references to the class were always updated. This bug has been fixed.
- The UNDO operation for move operations had left an inconsistent model in certain cases (e.g. with master objects). This error has been fixed.
- If an InternalElement is affected by a split operation, mirror references to outsourced elements have not been changed correctly.
- The title of the Header Editor did not always display the name of the edited object. This error has been fixed. 
- If a mirror attribute is located in a different attribute tree than its master element, the target is now visualized and correctly selected when navigating to the master element via 'Goto Master'.
- Fixed some issues related to the handling of double click events on tree view items
- Fixed some issues related to the presentation of the paste dialog and the selection of options.
- In the attribute editor, when changing the selected object with attributes, the previously selected attribute was still displayed in the editor, although no attribute was selected from the newly selected object for editing. This error has been fixed.
- Fixed the editor property view of the nominal scaled constraint editor.
- Fixed an issue in the paste dialog where the optional paste properties were not visible or editable.
- Library Relation Diagram will only show related libraries of the selected type when dependency relations are not selected.
- It is allowed, to create multiple new versions of a single class or type.
