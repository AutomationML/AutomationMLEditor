# AutomationML Editor

The latest [**Version 6.4.0**](https://github.com/AutomationML/AutomationMLEditor/releases/tag/v6.4.0), developed by the AutomationML Association, provides new functions for the first time that open up new possibilities for semantic modeling. In addition, a new license model allows a wider user community to use the editor as a full version without having to be a member. Further information can be found [here](https://www.automationml.org/about-automationml/aml-tools/automationml-editor/).

## What’s new?

With the innovative AutomationML ID concept, we now enable global access to semantic libraries, revolutionizing the world of automation. Through a state-of-the-art publication mechanism, AutomationML libraries can be systematically reviewed, published, and versioned. Additionally, online search functionalities make libraries and classes globally discoverable and accessible on servers worldwide.

These new capabilities mark a significant milestone in the evolution of AutomationML. We are leveraging the foundation for semantic modeling of complex systems, contributing to standardization and digitalization of the exchange of engineering data in industry.

-----------------------------------------------

The AutomationML Editor offers more **support for the management and creation of AutomationML class libraries** according to [Conventions for the modelling of AutomationML libraries](https://www.automationml.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Conventions-for-modelling-AutomationML-libraries-V1.0.0-external.pdf). Compared to previous versions, the use of the class and attribute type libraries, offered by AutomationML, has been fundamentally improved and standardized. These libraries are only integrated into your own documents via external references, using fixed server URLs. 

The most important improvement is the distribution of AutomationML libraries via a publicly accessible **AML library space**. The editor contains a preconfigured access to the **AutomationML Library Releases**. However, it is also possible to configure a company-owned or privately used **AML library space** as long as it is accessible via the WebDAV/Https network protocol. All configured servers can also be used in parallel.

You can find detailed instructions on how to use the new features in the wiki on the following topics:

## Instructions for use

**AutomationML editor** has been developed by the **AutomationML** society in order to visualize major AutomationML concepts and provides functionality to visualize, create and edit AutomationML/CAEX files. The AutomationML editor is suited for educational purposes and a perfect entry point for learning, experimenting and understanding AutomationML. However, the number of features and functionalities of the AutomationML editor does not represent the entire modelling scope of AutomationML. AutomationML editor is provided by AutomationML e.V. and distributed under the MIT license.
You can also get detailed help on how to use it in the [AutomationML Editor Wiki](https://github.com/AutomationML/AutomationMLEditor/wiki).
